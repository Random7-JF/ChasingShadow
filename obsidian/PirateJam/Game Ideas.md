# Theme

### Shadows and Alchemy

The community decided on combining the two winning themes of Shadows and Alchemy. Shadows can relate to a number of different subjects outside of light levels. Think about shadow governments, secret societies, or elemental effects. Alchemy can also be used for much more than mixing potions. Alchemy is about transformation, synthesis, combination, and hidden knowledge.

Themes are meant to be a restriction that you need to solve your way out of. Don't despair if this is a theme you dislike, instead try to find a creative solution where you can have fun and try something you otherwise wouldn't have.

As always good luck!
