## Concept

## Gameplay Overview

You are the light, chasing the shadow through the game levels. At the start  of each level you get to see the route the shadow follows and you must reach the end in the set time.  Your route can differ in order to gain buffs and bonuses.

### Theme 

Game jam theme is "Shadows and Alchemy". The way the game is incorporating the theme is the light chasing the shadow and the buffs and potions that can be found around the world. 

## Mechanics

### Platformer

This is a side prospective platformer, with the ability to up and down, back and forward. There will  be ledges to traverse on and area's the player can fall. 

### Enemies

Enemies will patrol small areas and act as obstacles for the player, they can be avoided or killed. 

### Chests and Keys

Chests grant buffs to the player via potions. These can be opened by finding a specific key for the chest and unlocking it. 

### Player

Player has health, enemies will hurt this health (some potions may as well.) Killing enemies will grant health back for the player.  If the player falls to their death, hits 0 health the game goes back to the last checkpoint. 

### Shadow

Once you reach the shadow, It will be a boss style fight where you fight to the end. Once the shadow is defeated you win. 

## Art

### Palette

Looking to make a mostly Black / White style game with some grey to make things stand out.
### Design

Very straight forward design with stick figure style guys for the light and the shadow. enemies will be something simple like maybe a skeleton.

#### Music

Some upbeat background music to incite challenge.
